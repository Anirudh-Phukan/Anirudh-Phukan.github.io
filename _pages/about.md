Hi, I am Anirudh. Iâ€™m currently working as a Research Associate at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence from the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IIT Guwahati)](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). My research interests include the interpretability of foundation models and leveraging the insights gained to develop robust and efficient solutions for real-world applications.
