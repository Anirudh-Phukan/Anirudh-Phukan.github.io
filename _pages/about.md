Hi, I'm Anirudh, a Research Associate at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/). I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering with a minor in Robotics and Artificial Intelligence from the [Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati (IIT Guwahati)](https://www.iitg.ac.in/). I am deeply passionate about interpretability in foundation models and applying these insights to develop robust, efficient solutions for real-world applications.

At [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/), I collaborate with [Dr. Apoorv Saxena](https://research.adobe.com/person/apoorv-saxena/) and [Dr. Balaji V. Srinivasan](https://research.adobe.com/person/balaji-vasan-srinivasan/) on advancing the attribution engine for Adobe Acrobat AI Assistant, a system that provides document references as evidence for AI-generated answers. Notably, I led the development of the [technology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19187) powering attribution in contracts.

My current focus is on improving the attribution feature by incorporating multimodality and multilinguality. Additionally, I have also worked on detecting and mitigating textual/visual hallucinations, optimizing LLM inference, improving context focus in LLMs and revisualising infographics for better user consumption.

During my undergraduate studies at IIT Guwahati, I completed my bachelorâ€™s thesis under the guidance of Prof. [Arijit Sur](https://www.iitg.ac.in/arijit/). My research explored Visual Representation Learning, specifically harnessing inherent intra-class variation to improve contrastive learning methods. This approach provided richer and more effective contrasts compared to traditional data augmentations. Previously, I worked with Prof. [Shyamanta M. Hazarika](https://www.iitg.ac.in/s.m.hazarika/) on grasp recognition, employing techniques like Inverse Reinforcement Learning and high-level semantic information such as object affordances.
